After talking with several people I realized that there are a lot of questions regarding the Windows 11 upgrade. For those of you who don't know, Windows 10 will no longer receive security updates after October of this year (October 14, 2025). It is recommended to upgrade to Windows 11 some time before then.

In this post I will go through what I feel will be common questions regarding the update:

## When will I have to update?

To maintain optimal security you will have to update to Windows 11 or buy a new computer with Windows 11 some time before October 14th, 2025. If you don't update by then, I would advise to not use the computer to login to any accounts. Especially email, password management, banking, and social media accounts.

## Is there a cost associated?

The Windows 11 update itself is free for home users running compatible hardware. The only costs associated are if your computer is too old to have a TPM 2.0 chip on its CPU.

## Should I do anything prior?

Once in a great while I have seen major updates, such as the update to Windows 11 fail and require a wipe and restore. I would advise running a backup right before running the update.

Also, as in the previous article, I would advise to run occasional backups anyway. You never know when you're going to need them, and with Bitlocker protecting your data, it's hard or impossible to recover data after the fact if there are no backups. If you don't want to buy additional software or don't trust "the cloud" there is an alternative option.

1. Buy a portable hard drive. Amazon link [here](https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Elements-Portable-External/dp/B06W55K9N6). Or you can pick one up at a local electronics retailer.
2. Install an application like [FreeFileSync](https://freefilesync.org/), and setup a job to the portable hard drive. [Direct download for version 13.9](https://freefilesync.org/download/FreeFileSync_13.9_Windows_Setup.exe), the website has ads with fake download buttons so be advised if this link expires. 
3. If you want offsite backups, you can get multiple portable hard drives, and rotate them occasionally. See video below on how to setup multiple settings, (borrowing from another content creator for now until I have time to make my own content).

## Can I update manually?

If you miss the prompts or your free time to do so doesn't line up to when you're prompted, yes, you can manually initiate the upgrade.

By clicking on the start menu, then the Settings (gear icon, left side of start menu) app. On the Settings app, there should be a section that says Updates & security, or should be a Windows Update button. Then on the left you can make sure you're on the Windows Update section. Then near the middle there should be an option to check compatibility and update to Windows 11.

## Are there any other options?

If your computer doesn't support Windows 11 or you don't want to upgrade to it, yes, there are other options but they likely aren't for the faint of heart. Keep in mind, that if you need to run commercial software for employment or side-gigs, such as Adobe's suite, then you will have to stick to Windows or switch to an Apple Mac device. Otherwise you can consider the option below. While backing up first, of course.

Linux Mint - A Linux distribution that brings in many familiar aspects of the Windows experience to Linux. Including: An easy installer, Main menu that resembles a start menu, and draggable windows.

- Cinnamon edition - What I would recommend for most computers. Only for the bottom tier would I recommend the XFCE or MATE editions.

## What if I need help?

If you need help and you're within Allegany County, NY, feel free to contact me. The most surefire way to get ahold of me is via email, dilan AT gillulyit DOT com. My business line is dependent on me having the VOIP application open on my computer and I have to keep the screening service going on my cell or I'll get spammed.

If you need help and you're outside of my geographic scope, consider the following when selecting a computer repair service that's best for you:

1. Honesty: You can test to see how honest a business or repair tech is by asking them a question you already know the answer to. You can research some basic computer knowledge, like how much storage space each picture takes up generally (one thing dishonest techs or businesses do is upsell storage requirements to make a better margin).
2. Distance: Generally the more distant the business or tech is from you, the more they'll charge in travel fees.
3. Additional requirements: If you have mobility issues that makes it difficult for you to leave your property, going with a housecall service or one with pickup and delivery services is likely a good idea. Keep in mind this level of service may cost more.
4. Urgency: Some dishonest repair techs and businesses will tell you that you need to upgrade right away, aside from the 14th of October. And creating a false sense of urgency is scam-like behavior. Microsoft set the deadline, and that can be corroborated by mainstream media articles on the matter.
