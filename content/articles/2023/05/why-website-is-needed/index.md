Web Developers recommending websites to small businesses is sometimes seen as being too pushy. One reason why is because social media sites are easy to use and free. While it's great to have social media pages, there are some upsides to having a website too. I'll go over a few reasons why:

## Potential Patrons Social Media Hiatuses

Social media has its downsides and for that reason some people decide not to get on it at all or limit their activity. That means that they may avoid using Facebook or Twitter to look up business information such as hours. Instead they may turn to a competitor who has a website.

## Professional appearance

Having a custom website domain on a business card and other stationary, looks more professional to a lot of people than having a Facebook link. And for certain industries, like technology and business consulting, having an email address of a custom domain is more professional looking as well.

## Censorship action

Many people moderate their business' page using the same account they post personal opinions on. The reason why this can be problematic is because said account can be blocked or banned from the platform for sharing uncommon opinions.

While it, in my opinion, is true that one shouldn't mix business with politics; the fact of the matter is that there is a dividing line between personal social media accounts and business pages. But social media companies don't see it that way, Facebook especially, will deactivate a business page for violations on the personal side.

A webhost, while they're not perfect, are a lot less likely to censor content. It has to be very heinous or illegal for them to do so in most situations.
