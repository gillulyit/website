Born from a family with Irish lineage, with a lot of tradesmen, mostly electricians; Dilan Gilluly decided to get into computers at a young age. Building his first computer at the age of 13 years old, which was equipped with an AMD Athlon 64 3500+ CPU. Most of the parts for the build were gifts from his family.

Using said computer Dilan learned HTML and CSS website design, as well as VB.Net programming. These skills not only transitioned into doing computer work on contract, but by 2017, Dilan started making a Microsoft Access database application using quite a bit of VBA programming, for the annual SPCA Serving Allegany County Theme Basket Auction. While said database application is now Python based, it still is maintained mostly by Dilan Gilluly.
